   2. Compare real-time APY against Aave baseline
   3. Automated migration based on 7-day moving averages
   4. Risk-adjusted returns accounting for smart contract age

3. **Aerodrome + Uniswap V3 LP Management**
   1. Deploy stable LP positions (USDC/USD1, USDC/EURC) on Aerodrome
   2. Use Uniswap V3 concentrated liquidity for better capital efficiency
   3. Rebalance based on trading fees vs impermanent loss calculations
   4. Harvest rewards weekly and compound into ETH DCA

4. **FX Arbitrage via DEX Routing**
   1. Monitor EURC/USDC, USD1/USDC price differences across venues
   2. Execute triangular arbitrage when spreads exceed gas costs
   3. Route through best execution path using existing aggregators
   4. Capture basis differentials between stablecoin pairs

contract TreasuryManager {
    // Proven protocol integrations
    function depositToAave(uint256 amount) external onlyTreasury;
    function rebalanceToHighestYield() external onlyKeeper;
    function executeArbitrage(address tokenA, address tokenB) external;
